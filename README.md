## How to build it

The project is built with Cmake. You can either use CMakeLists.txt directly in your IDE (tested only with QT Creator) or build using the command line.
Here are details instructions on how to build it from command line on Linux :

- Clone the git repository into your local machine
- Create a new folder where the build will be done (we will take build-InvoiceManager here as an example)
- Go to this directory, and run "cmake [PATH_TO_INVOICEMANAGER_REPOSITORY] ./
- run "cmake --build ."
You should have an "InvoiceManager" executable file. You can launch it directly to run InvoiceManager.
